            FAIRC is a research collective for fundamental AI research. We work
            at the boundary of theory and experiment, driven by the conviction
            that the deepest questions in artificial intelligence—how it learns,
            what it represents, and how we ensure it remains aligned—require
            rigorous, first-principles investigation.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem" }}>
            Our scope is broad by design. We pursue any line of inquiry that
            advances the mechanistic understanding of intelligent systems: from
            the mathematics of representation to the biology of cognition, from
            the safety of deployment to the dynamics of embodied agents. The
            projects we are locked in on today are a starting point, not a
            boundary.

                <h3>Empirical &amp; Modern Innovation</h3>
                <p>
                  We target the frontier where current systems fracture:
                  long-horizon agency, episodic memory, and state tracking over
                  extended interactions. Our work begins with the concrete
                  failure modes of today&apos;s strongest models—loss of
                  coherence in multi-step reasoning, inability to maintain world
                  models over time, and the brittleness of tool use. Alongside
                  building, we are equally interested in explaining:
                  characterizing the mechanics of in-context learning and
                  disentangling the variables that drive emergent capabilities so
                  that progress becomes a predictable science rather than a
                  lottery.

                <h3>Neuroscience-Inspired Intelligence</h3>
                <p>
                  The brain solves problems that deep learning still cannot:
                  continual learning without catastrophic forgetting, one-shot
                  generalization, and energy-efficient inference. We study the
                  computational principles of neural circuits—sparse distributed
                  coding, predictive error minimization, Hebbian plasticity,
                  columnar organization—to extract architecturally useful
                  inductive biases. The goal is not biomimicry, but identifying
                  which neuroscientific principles translate into concrete
                  improvements in artificial systems.

                <h3>Mathematical Foundations</h3>
                <p>
                  Why does a specific architecture work? We treat this as a
                  search problem: training is search over function space,
                  architecture design is search over the space of possible
                  inductive biases, and both are constrained by
                  information-theoretic and computational limits. We pursue
                  mathematical frameworks that explain why certain architectures
                  and training methods succeed—connecting phenomena like
                  grokking, superposition, and scaling laws to fundamental
                  constraints on learnability—with the explicit aim of using
                  these theories to design better systems rather than merely
                  describe existing ones.

                <h3>AI Safety &amp; Alignment</h3>
                <p>
                  Alignment is a structural property, not a wrapper. We tackle
                  the hard problems of scalable oversight and deceptive
                  alignment: how do we verify systems that are smarter than us,
                  and how do we detect when a model is gaming its reward
                  function? Our interpretability research (routing-based
                  monosemanticity, circuit discovery) builds the necessary tools
                  for this verification—allowing us to inspect internal reasoning
                  chains, detect instrumental convergence before it manifests in
                  behavior, and ensure that our models remain truthful even when
                  unobserved.

                <p>
                  Sequential decision-making under uncertainty remains one of
                  the hardest open problems in AI. We work on RL from both ends:
                  the theoretical side (sample complexity bounds,
                  exploration-exploitation in high-dimensional state spaces,
                  offline RL with distribution shift) and the applied side
                  (sim-to-real transfer, learned dynamics models, and
                  contact-rich manipulation where current policies consistently
                  fail).
